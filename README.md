## How It Works

1. **Select an App:**  
   Use the sidebar to choose between the **Event Data App** and the **Graph Data App**. An expandable info panel provides details about what each app does.

2. **Set Your Date Range:**  
   Specify the start and end dates for the data you want to load.

3. **Apply Filters:**  
   - For the **Event Data App**, enter Actor codes to filter by country or actor. You can also filter by Event Codes using the hierarchical CAMEO Event Code Dictionary.
   - For the **Graph Data App**, enter keywords (comma-separated) to filter the data based on the THEMES column.

4. **Toggle EventCode Dictionary:**  
   In the Event Data App, click the **Toggle EventCode Dictionary** button to show or hide the collapsible, hierarchical view of CAMEO Event Codes.

5. **Load and Download Data:**  
   Click the **Load Data** button to fetch data. A progress bar indicates the download process, and once completed, you can download your data as a ZIP file containing a CSV.
